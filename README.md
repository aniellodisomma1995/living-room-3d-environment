# living-room-3d-environment
High-quality 3D living room environment created for architectural visualization. Includes realistic lighting, materials, and furniture layout.

All objects are fully textured, with attention to materials such as wood, fabrics, metals, and glass. Transparent elements like mirrors, glass tables, and balcony doors are included in the final render for realism.  

**Note:** Some transparent objects (glass tables, mirrors, balcony doors) do not appear in Substance Painter during the texturing process, but they are present and correctly rendered in Maya/V-Ray.  

The project demonstrates a complete interior visualization setup, including:  
- Detailed geometry of walls, floors, and furniture  
- Accurate UV mapping for optimal texture placement  
- Physically-based materials and shaders compatible with V-Ray  
- Realistic lighting setup for natural and artificial light  
- High-quality photorealistic rendering showcasing reflections, shadows, and materials  

This environment can be used as a reference, for portfolio purposes, or as a base for further interior visualization projects.
